# Bengaluru House Price Predictor

Overview
The Bengaluru House Price Predictor is a web application built with Python and Streamlit, designed to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on specific property features. It leverages machine learning techniques, particularly the RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn, to provide accurate predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values in the dataset.
Extracts relevant features like number of bathrooms, balconies, bedroom size, and total square feet.
Cleans and transforms the data to prepare it for model training.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Utilizes RandomForestRegressor to build a predictive model.
Splits the data into training and testing sets for model validation.
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
User Interface:

Provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
Allows users to input desired property features (number of bathrooms, balconies, bedrooms, and total square feet).
Predicts the house price based on the input features and displays the result.
Deployment:

The application is intended for local deployment.
Users can interact with the app by running streamlit run app.py after installing required dependencies.
How to Use
Installation:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install necessary Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Application:

Navigate to the project directory in the command line.
Execute streamlit run app.py to launch the Streamlit app locally.
Using the App:

Enter the number of bathrooms, balconies, size (in terms of bedrooms), and total square feet of the property you wish to predict.
Click the "Predict Price" button to see the estimated house price in lakhs (INR).
Future Improvements
Enhanced Model Performance:

Explore advanced algorithms or ensemble techniques for improved accuracy.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
User Interface Enhancements:

Add visualizations to illustrate data distributions and model predictions.
Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to enhance usability.
Deployment Options:

Consider deploying the application on cloud platforms for broader accessibility.
Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated updates and deployments.
Conclusion
The Bengaluru House Price Predictor is a practical tool for prospective home buyers and real estate professionals in Bengaluru. It provides a straightforward means to estimate property prices based on key features, combining ease of use with powerful machine learning capabilities.
